                <h2>CIVIL ENGINEERING</h2>
                <h3>General Information</h3>
                <p>
                    Engineering is the art of organising and managing people and controlling materials and power in
                    nature. Based on this definition, civil engineering is one of the most fundamental branches of
                    engineering.

                    <strong>What do civil engineers do?</strong>
                    Civil engineers take the material in nature, put it into a certain form and put it to use in a way
                    that is beneficial to humanity. Contrary to popular belief, civil engineers do not only build
                    buildings. They take part in every aspect of the zoning and construction of countries. Some of these
                    are railway, highway, bridge, dam, power plant, factory, industrial plant, treatment plant, port,
                    airport, business centre.

                    <strong>About Our Department</strong>
                    Department of Civil Engineering was established in 2013. There are regular education and graduate
                    programmes.

                    <strong>Academic Year</strong>
                    An academic year consists of fourteen-week autumn and spring semesters. The duration of
                    undergraduate education is eight semesters (four years).

                    <strong>Language of Instruction</strong>
                    The medium of instruction at Uşak University is Turkish. There is also an optional English
                    Preparatory Programme.
                    <strong>Registration and Counselling Services</strong>
                    While the registration procedures of the students who will start our university are carried out on
                    the dates determined by ÖSYM, the registration renewal procedures for the students in the
                    intermediate classes are carried out online between the dates announced by our university, under the
                    knowledge and supervision of the Department of Student Affairs and the counsellor lecturers
                    established in the students' own units.

                    <strong>Assessment and Evaluation</strong>
                    Graduation and success in courses are determined according to the credit system. Exams consist of
                    midterm and final exams. At least one midterm exam is held for each course. The method of pure
                    evaluation and relative evaluation is applied in the success grade. The values obtained are
                    converted into letter grades through Uşak University Student Automation System. The student has to
                    take one midterm and one final exam in a semester. During the evaluation, 40% of the student's
                    midterm exams, homework, attendance and laboratory studies during the semester and 60% of the final
                    exam are taken and a general evaluation is made.

                    <strong>Horizontal Transfer</strong>
                    Applications for transfer between higher education institutions applying equivalent education
                    programmes are made at the beginning of the academic year in higher education institutions applying
                    the year system, at the beginning of each semester in higher education institutions applying the
                    semester system, and applications for transfer before the start of the courses are made with the
                    decision of the board of directors of faculties and colleges.

                    <strong>Vertical Transfer</strong>
                    It is a programme that enables successful students who graduated from Vocational Schools and open
                    education associate degree programmes to be placed in formal education. In this programme, all
                    vertical transfers, except for the Open Education Faculty, are carried out by a vertical transfer
                    exam organised by ÖSYM.

                    <strong>Double Major - Minor Programmes</strong>
                    With the Double Major programme, students who successfully complete their major undergraduate
                    programmes are also provided with the opportunity to study for a second undergraduate degree.

                    With the minor programme, students who successfully complete their major undergraduate programmes
